<h1>Thai Coconut Chicken Curry</h1>

Moline received this recipe in Relief Society and we had it camping. It was delicious.  - Ben<br>

I call Thai curry my "emergency hurricane food" because in Florida, every year
right around late August we start getting nasty hurricanes and I like to have a
ton of food on hand. Most of the ingredients come from cans and you can even
skip the chicken altogether and substitute canned straw mushrooms.  If you are
not into spice you might try half the curry paste.<br>
<br>
Serves 5-7 (when served with rice)<br>
<br>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>4 oz (125 g) Thai curry paste
	<li>4 cups (1 liter) coconut milk, divided
	<li>1 tablespoon fish sauce
	<li>1 teaspoon sugar
	<li>3 fresh kaffir lime leaves, torn (optional)
	<li>6 oz (175 g) skinless, boneless chicken, cut into thin, bite-size pieces
	<li>1 8 oz (250 g) fresh or canned sliced bamboo shoots
	<li>1 15 oz (530 g) can baby corn, cut in half lengthwise
	<li>1/2 red onion, sliced
	<li>1/2 cup (12 g) loosely packaged fresh Thai basil or sweet italian basil leaves
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Add curry paste to a medium pot and turn the head to medium-low. As the
	pot heats up, the curry paste will begin to fry, release its oils and
	become fragrant. It's best to keep the heat fairly low as you are doing
	this--otherwise you may burn the curry paste.
	<li>When the pot is hot and the curry paste is fragrant, pour in half of
	the coconut milk and turn the heat to high. Whisk until the curry paste has
	dissolved into the coconut milk. Pour in the remaining coconut milk, fish
	sauce, sugar and kaffir lime leaves. Bring the curry to a gentle boil and
	then add the chicken slices, bamboo shoots, baby corn, and red onion. Stir
	well and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes, until the chicken has cooked through.
	Timing depends on how thin you sliced your chicken. Turn off the heat, stir
	in the basil leaves and serve with steamed Jasmine rice.
